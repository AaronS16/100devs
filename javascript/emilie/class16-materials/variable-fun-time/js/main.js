//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let number = 20 
//minus 10 from that number

    let banana = number - 10
    console.log(banana)
//print that number to the console

//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
 let holdVariable = document.querySelector("#danceDanceRevolution").value 
//add 25 to that number
holdVariable = holdVariable + 25
//alert that number
alert(holdVariable)

//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
