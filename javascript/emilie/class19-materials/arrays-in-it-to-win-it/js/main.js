//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ['bobs1','bobs2','bobs3']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let moviesOne = movies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrayLength = movies.length
console.log(arrayLength)
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[movies.length - 1]
