//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number

let fun = 6

//minus 10 from that number

fun -= 10

//print that number to the console

console.log (fun)

//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input

let input = document.querySelector('#danceDanceRevolution').value

//add 25 to that number

input += 25

//alert that number

alert(input)

//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1



//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables
