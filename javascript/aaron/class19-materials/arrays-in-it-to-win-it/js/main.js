//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ['Godzilla', 'Jay and Silent Bob', 'Bobs Burgers Movie']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let old = movies[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let number = movies.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let last = movies[movies.length - 1]

console.log(last)
